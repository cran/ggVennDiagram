\title{plot all shapes provided by internal dataset}
\usage{
plot_shapes()
}
\description{
These shapes are mainly collected from the package `venn`, and `VennDiagram`.
For Venn plot with more than 4 sets, it is usually impossible to plot with
simple circle or ellipse. So we need to use a predefined coordinates in plot.

\details{
- Shape 101, 201, 301, 401, 402, 501, 502, 601 and 701 are from `venn`
- Shape 401f is from `VennDiagram`

see `data-raw/shapes.R` to find how we incorporate these data.
